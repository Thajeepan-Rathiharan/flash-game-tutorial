# BTEC Flappy Bird

## Outcomes
With my current knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript I have now learnt that I can make basic flash games using these coding languages. However there were obstacles in the way, one being that I was getting confused with the variables but I overcame that by using the tutorial on the W3Schools site to check my code with. In the future I am thinking of making a similar flash game that uses the mouse click to do something like an RPG fighting flash game.
